The task is to help Lord Rama's army find a largest consecutive subsequence of stones from a given sequence of stone values such that:
1. The sum of the subsequence values is divisible by 5.
2. The subsequence must be contiguous (consecutive stones).
3. If multiple subsequences have the same sum divisible by 5, choose the longest one.
4. If no such subsequence exists, return an empty result.
